==== WORKFLOW ====

1. Find dataset (of a certain domain), save in "datasets" 

2. Cleansing of the dataset (i. e. with OpenRefine, Python, R)

3. Learn adjacency list of graph with script "dataset_to_graph.py"

	with "python dataset_to_graph.py -f datasets/DATASET.csv"

4. Check visualization and note dependencies

5. Compare dependencies with actual documented dependencies of the dataset

6. Documentation of the result
